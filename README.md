The main goal of this software tool is to detect, count and mark the text lines in images of handwritten manuscripts. This version contains features to detect vertical text-lines and bright text-lines on darker background.

The main tasks achieved by this software tool are:

- Detecting lines in pre-selected orientation.
- Calculating min and max spacing, and density within a pre-specified length.
- Providing evaluation of detection accuracy for images with ground-truth information.
- Generating visualisation of detection histogram for manual inspection.
- Allowing for rotation correction and parameter change in order to optimise the detection results.
