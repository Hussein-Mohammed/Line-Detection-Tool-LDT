# Line Detection Tool (LDT)

The main goal of the LDT is to analyse images of writing supports in order to detect lines (such as sieve imprints or papyri fibres) and estimate their density. These detected lines form a pattern, which can be used as a distinctive feature of the writing support.

The main tasks achieved by this software tool are:

- Detecting lines in pre-selected orientation.
- Calculating min and max spacing, and density within a pre-specified length.
- Providing evaluation of detection accuracy for images with ground-truth information.
- Generating visualisation of detection histogram for manual inspection.
- Allowing for rotation correction and parameter change in order to optimise the detection results.
